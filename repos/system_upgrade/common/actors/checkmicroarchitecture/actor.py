    Inhibit if RHEL9 microarchitecture requirements are not satisfied


    As per `x86-64-ABI`_ In addition to the AMD64 baseline architecture, several
    micro-architecture levels implemented by later CPU modules have been
    defined, starting at level ``x86-64-v2``. The levels are cumulative in the
    sense that features from previous levels are implicitly included in later
    levels.

    RHEL9 has a higher CPU requirement than older versions, it now requires a
    CPU compatible with ``x86-64-v2`` instruction set or higher. Similarly,
    RHEL10 requires at least ``x86-64-v3`` instruction set.

    .. table:: Required CPU features by microarchitecure level with a
               corresponding flag as shown by ``lscpu``.
